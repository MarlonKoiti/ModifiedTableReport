# ModifiedTableReport
Relatório de atualização de tabelas no Databricks

This project was conceived and developed by me, this notebook will help my team to keep the loads working and in case someone has problems with the loads
this notebook can help us because it generates a report with some information including lastModified, basically if the lastModified 
date does not correspond to the same data of the day of the report, we have a great chance of having an error with the load.

You need to put the name of the databases where you want to inspect and run.
